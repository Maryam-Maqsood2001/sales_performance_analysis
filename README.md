# Sales Team Performance Analysis Backend

## Overview

This project is a backend system that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sales data and provide performance feedback for individual sales representatives and the entire team. The system is built using Flask, integrates OpenAI's GPT for natural language insights, and provides multiple RESTful API endpoints for feedback generation.

## Features

- Ingest sales data in CSV or JSON format.
- Analyze individual sales representatives' performance.
- Assess overall team performance.
- Forecast sales trends and provide insights.
- API endpoints to query performance data.
  
## Requirements

Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Virtual environment (optional but recommended)

## Installation

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/sales-performance-analysis.git
   cd sales-performance-analysis
   ```

2. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional):

   - Windows:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - macOS/Linux:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. Install Dependencies:

   Run the following command to install all the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set Up OpenAI API Key:

   You need to set your OpenAI API key in the `app.py` file:

   ```python
   openai.api_key = 'your-openai-api-key'
   ```

## Running the Application

To start the Flask server:

```bash
python app.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:5000`.

### Available API Endpoints

1. Get Feedback for a Sales Representative:
   - URL: `/api/feedback/sales_performance_analysis`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Description: Returns feedback for a specific sales representative.
   - Example: 
     ```bash
     GET http://localhost:5000/api/feedback/JohnDoe
     ```

   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "feedback": "Generated feedback for sales representative JohnDoe."
     }
     ```

2. Get Overall Team Performance:
   - URL: `/api/team_performance`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Description: Returns the overall performance of the sales team.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     GET http://localhost:5000/api/team_performance
     ```

   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "feedback": "Overall team performance insights."
     }
     ```

3. Get Sales Performance Trends and Forecast:
   - URL: `/api/performance_trends`
   - Method: `GET`
   - Description: Returns sales performance trends and forecasting data.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     GET http://localhost:5000/api/performance_trends
     ```

   - Response:
     ```json
     {
       "feedback": "Sales performance trends and forecast."
     }
     ```

## Testing the API

You can use Postman, Insomnia, or `cURL` to test the API endpoints.

- Example with `cURL`:
  ```bash
  curl -X GET http://localhost:5000/api/feedback/JohnDoe
  ```

- Example with Postman:
  1. Open Postman.
  2. Set the method to `GET`.
  3. Enter `http://localhost:5000/api/feedback/JohnDoe` in the URL.
  4. Click Send to get the response.

## Troubleshooting

- SSL Errors: If you encounter SSL handshake errors, ensure that your internet connection is stable, and check for any proxy issues.
- OpenAI Key Error: Ensure your OpenAI API key is correct and valid. If the key is incorrect, the LLM integration will fail.
