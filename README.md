# Sales Team Performance Analysis

## Overview
The Sales Team Performance Analysis project implements a backend system that utilizes a Large Language Model (LLM) to analyze sales data. The system provides insights and feedback on both individual sales representatives and the overall performance of the sales team. This application serves as a valuable tool for sales managers and team leaders to make data-driven decisions and improve sales strategies.

## Features
- Individual Performance Analysis: Analyze the performance of individual sales representatives based on their sales data.
- Team Performance Summary: Generate a comprehensive summary of the overall performance of the sales team.
- Performance Trends and Forecasting: Analyze historical sales data to identify trends and forecast future performance.
- LLM-Generated Insights: Leverage the capabilities of a Large Language Model to provide qualitative feedback and actionable insights based on sales performance data.

## Technologies Used
- Flask: A lightweight WSGI web application framework for Python, which provides the core functionality for building web applications and APIs.
- Pandas: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library for Python, used to handle and process sales data efficiently.
- OpenAI API: Integration with a Large Language Model (such as GPT-3) to generate insights and feedback based on sales performance data.

## Setup and Run Instructions
Follow these steps to set up and run the application locally:

1. Clone the repository:
   Open your terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd sales_performance_analysis
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment:
   Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

3. Install the required packages:
   Use pip to install the necessary dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Configure OpenAI API Key:
   In the `llm_integration.py` file, replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual OpenAI API key to enable LLM functionality.

5. Run the application:
   Start the Flask application by executing:
   ```
   python app.py
   ```

6. Access the API:
   The application will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You can use API testing tools like Postman or Insomnia to interact with the endpoints.
